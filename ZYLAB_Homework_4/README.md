My name is Katheryn Busch and in these ZYLABS for Homework 4 which are 12.7, 12.9, 14.11 and 14.13, are primarily focused on exceptions and sorting/searching.
These labsa are coded in Python. The motivation for these projects is to further improve my coding skillset.
These files are mainly direccted for the use of grading for CIS 2348 for the Teaching Assistants and Professor.
