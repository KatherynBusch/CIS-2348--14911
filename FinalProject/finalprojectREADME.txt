My name is Katheryn Busch and in this folder there is the py file for the final project, as well as a txt file to the link of the presentation.This project is coded in Python. The motivation for these projects is to further improve my coding skillset. These files are mainly directed for the use of grading for CIS 2348 for the Professor and Teaching Assistants.
